# my dotfiles

Remix from `holman dotfiles` and `atomantic MacOS bot`.

## Installation

Run this:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/georgiee/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles

script/bootstrap
```

This will add .dotfiles/bin to the path. You can then run `dot` frequently
to update your installation.

`dot` is a simple script that installs some dependencies, sets sane macOS
defaults, and so on. Tweak this script, and occasionally run `dot` from
time to time to keep your environment fresh and up-to-date. You can find
this script in `bin/`.
